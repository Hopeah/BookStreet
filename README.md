## Optimizations

Plenty of work can still be done, including (and most definitely not limited to..) integration with a book library API, responsive literature sorting according to user's wishes, more extensive literature info (e.g. date creation), other user comments on public literature/libraries, other user rating for public literature/libraries, other user profile visits, other user literature/library saving, email/password resets/changes, dark mode 

Priority right now: make forms for adding/editing/logging in/signing up prettier.

## Lessons Learned:

My most ambitious project to date that has many directions it can evolve in. Plenty of things were learned, from enhancing UX by providing simple and accessable UI to delving deep into MongoDB integration and making use of schemas inside of schemas.
